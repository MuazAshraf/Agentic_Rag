# Difference between Agentic and Naive based Rag
# Naive RAG 
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) simply retrieves relevant documents and generates responses based on them. It doesn't involve any complex reasoning or decision-making process beyond retrieving and generating.

# Agentic RAG 
on the other hand, uses agents or advanced systems to actively plan, make decisions, which tool to use againt the query utilize external resources (i.e., the tools and external search queries) before generating responses to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses, adding a layer of reasoning or autonomy.
